			    	<p> Pennywise the Dancing Clown, the main and favorite form that the creature takes. Pennywise wears a baggy silk suit of silver with orange pompoms and a collar ruff. He has a white face and a bald head, with red hair on either side. His mouth has a red clown smile. He wears large white gloves and is usually carrying a bunch of balloons.
The form of a friendly and funny clown is the easiest to invoke a sense of safety and comfort without needing to know anything personal about the victim, thus why IT uses it so often.
