			    	<p> Pennywise have the ability to transform into a great range of forms to embody his victim’s fears. Those can go from classical movie monsters, to the living image of the love ones of the victim. Some of his most infamous shapes are: Georgie (Bill´s brother), the Creature from the Black Lagoon, a giant bird, the Werewolf, a leper, the Mummy, The Crawling Eye, a swarm of winged leeches, the shark from Jaws, Dracula, a Paul Bunyan statue, the corpses of Patrick Hockstetter, "Belch" and Victor "Vic" Criss, Frankenstein's Monster, a ghost-moon, the deadlights and a giant spider (that is supposed to be the true physical form of IT on Earth).
