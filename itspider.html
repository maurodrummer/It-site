			    	<p> No one has ever seen Pennywise’s true form, but the closest to it would be the final form that he takes, a giant monstrous spider that appears in the climax of the novel, this is considered as close a representation to its true form as anyone will ever see. This is his most powerful physical form, when in this shape it can be observed that IT is in fact “female” because the spider seems to be pregnant, although being an omnipotent being, he can just be pregnant without the need of having a specific gender. Underneath that layer is the true form of IT, the Deadlights, but that is a realm beyond the physical and thus unable to be contemplated, described of watched by any human.
